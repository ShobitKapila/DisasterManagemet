Creating a complete system for real-time object detection and emergency notifications with video streaming, GPS, and SMS functionality is a complex task that requires integration of various technologies, including computer vision, machine learning, GPS tracking, and SMS APIs. Below is a high-level outline of how you can approach this task using Python. Please note that this is a simplified example, and developing a full-fledged system may require more extensive work and additional components.

1. Object Detection:
For object detection, you can use pre-trained deep learning models such as YOLO (You Only Look Once) or Faster R-CNN, which are capable of detecting multiple object categories. You can use popular computer vision libraries like OpenCV and TensorFlow for this purpose.

2. Real-time Video Stream:
You can capture real-time video footage from cameras using libraries like OpenCV or specialized hardware.

3. GPS Tracking:
To obtain GPS coordinates, you may need GPS hardware or access to a GPS module that provides real-time location data. This data can be collected and incorporated into your system.

4. SMS Notifications:
You can use third-party SMS gateway APIs like Twilio to send SMS notifications programmatically. You'll need to sign up for an account with Twilio and obtain API credentials.

5. Supervised Machine Learning:
You'll need a labeled dataset of images and videos for each category (collapsed building, traffic accidents, fire/smoke detection, and flood detection) to train a supervised machine learning model. Popular libraries for building and training ML models include scikit-learn, TensorFlow, or PyTorch.
Our Code needs to identify the cases of :-
1. collapsed building
2. Fire
3. flooded areas
4. traffic_incidents

If any of the above scenirios are detected then it must inform the concerned authorities. By sending the following data into there mobile apps:-
1. footage of the incident {for all the cases}
2. If **traffic_incidents** number plate of the vechiles that are caught in the incident to the nearest hospital including [ name of the person, blood group, contact person number]
3. if **fire** a drone that is equipied with the smoke estiguisher balls and alert to fire department
4. If **flood areas** instant survival kit drone to people and footage of the location of the people trapped inside the flood { makes it easy to locate them }
5. If **collapsed_building** the footage and location of the people trapped inside the building for easy location.
6. location { for all the cases }
